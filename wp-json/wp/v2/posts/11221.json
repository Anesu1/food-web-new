The VegfestUK Awards enter their 15th consecutive year in 2021, spanning an era that has witnessed the explosion of plant-based diets and ethical veganism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2021 has seen tremendous growth for us, especially after having recently joined forces with other leading vegan food brands Oumph! and LikeMeat as part of the LIVEKINDLY collective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When announcing the best vegan \u201cmeat\u201d substitutes category, VegFestUK founder Tim Barford, said: \u201cThe Favourite Vegan \u201cMeat\u201d Category is a hotly contested category to compete in because of the large amount of investment recently in the meat alternative sector.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our plant-based meat alternatives are extremely versatile and can be used in a number of vegan recipes.
