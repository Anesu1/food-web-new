A balanced flexitarian diet rich in whole foods and vegetables is great for the day to day management of diabetes but can also help those who want to maintain a healthy weight without going completely vegan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"so-what-is-a-flexitarian-diet\"><em>So what is a flexitarian diet?<\/em><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018Flexitarian\u2019 is a combination of the words <em>\u2018flexible\u2019<\/em> and <em>\u2018vegetarian\u2019<\/em>. It&#8217;s the best of both worlds for making small manageable dietary changes as you can alternate between meat focused meals and plant-based ones. Typically, a flexitarian will eat predominantly plant-based with smaller amounts of meat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"south-africans-want-to-be-healthier\"><em>South Africans want to be healthier!<\/em><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know that we are a meat-loving country.
