Vegan, plant-based, vegetarian, fruitarian, pescatarian, omnivore, herbivore, carnivore and now \u201cflexitarian\u201d?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people try to avoid labels because they know that with titles come restrictions. Did you \u201ccatch\u201d a vegan accidentally eating some mayonnaise with egg in it and give them a hard time? What if you\u2019re vegan and you genuinely just want to eat a dairy cheesy pizza. Does that mean you\u2019re not vegan anymore? It\u2019s kind of like being on a diet for your health. You might stick to healthy carbs, good fats and exercise, but what if you have a slice of delicious chocolate cake? Did you \u2018break\u2019 your diet? Lose all your progress? Of course not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s all about owning your own journey and being gentle with yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"so-what-are-the-key-differences-between-vegan-vegetarian-and-flexitarian\">So what are the KEY differences between VEGAN, VEGETARIAN and FLEXITARIAN:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Who eats meat?<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Vegans never eat meat or any form of animal product including dairy, eggs and honey. Vegetarians will eat eggs and dairy, but they don\u2019t eat meat. Flexitarians eat meat \u2018occasionally\u2019 but their focus is on eating mainly plant-based, often for health reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\" start=\"2\"><li><strong>Who eats eggs, cheese, and milk?<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Vegans don\u2019t, but Vegetarians and Flexitarians do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\" start=\"3\"><li><strong>Which one is better for the environment?<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a complicated debate but when breaking it down to its simplest form, a vegan diet has less impact than one that includes meat. Every meat-free meal can make a difference to both your health and the health of the planet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\" start=\"4\"><li><strong>Which diet is healthier for you?<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This depends on the person. You could be vegan and only eat deep-fried vegetables or eat a lot of unhealthy fats and carbs. Whether you eat meat or not, it\u2019s always important to have a balanced diet rich in varied fruits and veggies, good fats and proteins and unrefined carbohydrates. The trick is in finding the healthiest swops for your meat proteins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\" start=\"5\"><li><strong>Which diet is easiest to follow?<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, this depends on how much research and meal prep you do. With any diet, finding an online community and like-minded people will give you the best chance.
