When writing the book I really tried to tap into my lived experiences as a plant-based athlete, nutritionist, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HL-1XGd_d3E\">advocate<\/a>, mom and marketer to create something that was authentic, inspiring and easy to use,\u201d says Tammy Fry.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy dream was always to create something valuable and accessible that both inspires people to explore their own journey and support those that are already on one,\u201d she adds.<\/p>\n<p>Beverley Dodd, lifestyle publisher at Penguin Random House in South Africa says that a plant-based cookbook created by one of South Africa\u2019s leading advocates for the lifestyle was an obvious choice for them.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTammy\u2019s deep experience and understanding of what plant-based living means shone through in this book. It is a beautifully relatable, easy to follow guide for anyone, at any stage of the journey.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Beverley adds that Penguin Random House, who were also recognised by the Gourmand World Cookbook Awards as Best Cookbook Publisher in South Africa, have seen a notable increase in demand for plant-based lifestyle content.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere has been a definite increase in awareness around health and environment when it comes to food choices and our Best in South Africa winners reflect this.

As one of the Fry daughters, and a co-founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fryfamilyfood.com\/za\/\">The Fry Family Food Company<\/a>, she has been at the forefront of helping her parents pioneer plant-based foods in South Africa and across the globe.<\/p>\n<p>Chief Marketing Officer of <a href=\"https:\/\/thelivekindlyco.com\/\">LIVEKINDLY Collective<\/a> Mick van Ettinger says that this kind of recognition is an incredible acknowledgment of the power of real stories behind real brands.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI love how this beautiful cookbook, created with such love and passion by Tammy, has been so prestigiously recognised for its corporate tie-in to the Fry\u2019s brand. The incredible work the Fry family have done in building their brand, pioneering plant-based living and supporting new and existing consumers to explore their own journeys grew out of an authentic desire to gently change the world.
