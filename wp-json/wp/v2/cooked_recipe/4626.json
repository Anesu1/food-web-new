Mix the flour and yeast together. Then add in the salt. Mix the oil in until distributed. Lastly add in your water splash by splash until the dough starts to come together.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cooked-single-direction cooked-direction\" data-step=\"Step 2\">\n<div class=\"cooked-dir-content\">\n<p>Knead your dough for 3-5 minutes and then set it aside to rise for an hour. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cooked-single-direction cooked-direction\" data-step=\"Step 3\">\n<div class=\"cooked-dir-content\">\n<p>Whilst your dough is rising, prepare your toppings. In a large pan, fry your slicing sausage for 1-2 minutes and then add in your pepper, garlic, tomatoes, onion, olive oil, and all of your spices. Saute until everything is soft but not browned, approximately 7-9 minutes. Then stir in your parsley. Set your toppings aside to cool and  let the flavours come together whilst your dough continues to rise.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cooked-single-direction cooked-direction\" data-step=\"Step 4\">\n<div class=\"cooked-dir-content\">\n<p>Once your dough has risen, knock it back and divide it into several smaller round balls. This recipe makes approximately 6 balls. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cooked-single-direction cooked-direction\" data-step=\"Step 5\">\n<div class=\"cooked-dir-content\">\n<p>Roll or stretch each ball out into a flat bread shape.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cooked-single-direction cooked-direction\" data-step=\"Step 6\">\n<div class=\"cooked-dir-content\">\n<p>Place your flatbreads on your heated bbq. Grill for approximate 5 minutes on each side. Turn them frequently to check that they aren\u2019t burning. Remove them from the bbq when the dough is cooked through and the flatbreads are gently browned.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cooked-single-direction cooked-direction\" data-step=\"Step 7\">\n<div class=\"cooked-dir-content\">\n<p>Spread a bit of topping onto each flatbread. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cooked-single-direction cooked-direction\" data-step=\"Step 8\">\n<div class=\"cooked-dir-content\">\n<p>Place them on the grill and cook for about 5 further minutes (with the grill lid on).<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cooked-single-direction cooked-direction\" data-step=\"Step 9\">\n<div class=\"cooked-dir-content\">\n<p>Top them with more fresh parsley and a squeeze of lemon juice and enjoy! <\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":7187,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.4 -
